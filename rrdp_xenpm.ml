(* The goal of this plugin is to get the proportion of time the CPU(s)
   spent in it (their) different P and C states, as well the average
   clock frequency for each CPU.  This plugin could be easily rewritten
   using Xenctrl bindings by replicating the xenpm CLI computations. The
   author of the plugin did not manage to add the necessary bindings to
   Xenctrl in time. *)
